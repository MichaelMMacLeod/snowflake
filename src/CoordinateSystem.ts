// Coordinate system(s):
//
// 1: "World" space. This is two dimensional (x,y) with the origin,
// (0,0), in the center. X values increase towards positive infinity
// to the right and decrease to negative infinity to the left. Y
// values increase towards positive infinity going up and decrease to
// negative infinity going down. Radians refer to the angle that lines
// make with the line starting at (0,0) and extending directly right
// towards positive 'X', counterclockwise. So, for example, a vector
// emerging from the origin and going straight up (towards positive Y)
// would be at pi/2 radians. The part of the world that is visible on
// view is a 2x2 square centered at the origin.
//
// 2: "View" space. This is two dimensional (x,y) with the origin,
// (0,0), in the top left corner. X values increase towards positive
// infinity to the right and decrease to negative infinity to the
// left. Y values increase going *down* towards positive infinity and
// decrease towards negative infinity going *up*.
//
// World space is used for doing all the logical calculations
// necessary to grow the snowflake. All coordinates stored in objects
// are in world space. View space is used to draw the snowflake on
// the View and these coordinates are never saved anywhere.
